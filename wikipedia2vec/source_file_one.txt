ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life

they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now

a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video

restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life

right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine

this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people

we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more

is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life

i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you

a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths

and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else

i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress

our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life

they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now

a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video

restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life

right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine

this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people

we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more

is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life

i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you

a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths

and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else

i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress

our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life

they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now

a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video

restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life

right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine

this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream

understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace

today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more 
we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people

we need to create more tools to respond quickly and stop the fullscale russian invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 
it would be fair if it ended in 24 hours that people would be punished that evil would be punished 
today the people do not have such tools 
institutions should protect us from war but they unfortunately do not work 
we need new alliances and we offer them 
we propose to create an association united for peace a union of responsible countries to stop conflict immediately provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours weapons if necessary sanctions if necessary humanitarian support finances everything you need to keep the peace and quickly to save the world to save life 
such associations would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters who fell victim to humanitarian crisis or epidemics 
remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things just to get a vaccine against covid to save lives to prevent new strains 
the world spent months years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no victims 
ladies and gentlemen if such an alliance would exist today we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country in many countries around the world those who need peace those who suffer inhumane destruction 
i ask you to watch one video 
a video of what the russian troops did in our country in our land 
we have to destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations 
please watch the video 
in the end to be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
peace in your country does not depend only on you and your people 
it depends on those next to you on those who are strong 
strong does not mean weak 
strong is brave and ready to fight for his citizens as citizens of the world 
for human rights 
for freedom 
the right to live decently and die when your time comes and not when decided by somebody else 
today the ukrainian people are defending not only ukraine 
we are fighting for europe and the world and our lives in the name of the future 
that is why today the american people are helping not just ukraine but europe and the world to keep the planet alive 
to keep justice in history 
i am almost 45 years old 
today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating 
i see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths 
this is my mission as a leader of my people 
and as a leader of my nation 
im addressing president biden 
you are the leader of the nation of your great nation 
i wish you to be the leader of the world 
being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace 
ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy addressed the us congress on march 16 
below is a translated transcript of his speech primarily delivered in ukrainian and taken from thecspan network 
thank you very much madam speaker members of congress ladies and gentlemen 
americans friends 
i am proud to greet you from ukraine from our capital city of kyiv the city under missile and airstrikes from russians every day 
it does not give up 
we have not even thought about it for a second 
just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since world war ii 
i have been honored to greet you on behalf of the ukrainian people and freedomloving people who for years have been resisting russian aggression 
those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this fullscale russian invasion 
right now the destiny of our country is being decided 
the destiny of our people whether ukrainians will be free whether they will be able to preserve their democracy 
russia has attacked not just us not just our land our cities 
it went on a brutal offensive against our values 
basic human values 
against our freedom our right to live freely choosing our own future 
against our desire for happiness against our national dreams 
just like the same things you have you americans 
just like anyone else in the united states 
i remember the national memorial mount rushmore 
the faces of your prominent presidents those who laid the foundation of the united states of america 
democracy independence freedom 
for every person who works diligently who lives honestly who respects the law we in ukraine want the same for our people 
all that is a normal part of your own life 
ladies and gentlemen americans in your great history you would understand ukrainians 
understand us now 
we need you right now 
remember pearl harbor 
the morning of december 7 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you 
remember september 11 
a terrible day in 2001 when people tried to turn your cities into battlefields 
when innocent people were attacked attacked from the air 
no one expected it 
you couldnt stop it 
our country experiences the same every day 
right now this moment every night for three weeks in various ukrainian cities russia has turned the ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people 
russian troops have fired 1000 missiles at ukraine 
they use drones to kill us with precision 
this is a terror europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for an answer to this terror from the world 
is that a lot to ask to create a nofly zone over ukraine to save people 
is this too much to ask a nofly zone 
russia would not be able to terrorize our cities 
if this is too much to ask we offer an alternative 
you know what kind of defense systems we need 
you know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft to protect our people our freedom 
aircraft that can help ukraine help europe 
we know they exist and you have them 
they are not in ukrainian skies 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i have a dream 
i have a need 
i need to protect our skies 
i need your help which means the same you feel when you hear the words i have a dream 
ladies and gentlemen friends 
ukraine is grateful to the united states for its overwhelming support 
everything your government and your people have done for us for weapons and training for leadership to pressure the aggressor economically 
i am grateful to president biden for his sincere commitment to the defense of ukraine and democracy all over the world 
i am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all of those who commit crimes against ukraine as war criminals 
in the darkest times for our country i call on you to do more 
new sanctions are needed constantly every week until the russian military machine stops 
restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based all politicians in the russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against ukraine from the state duma members upwards 
all american companies must leave russia from their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood 
ladies and gentlemen members of congress 
if you have companies in your district who financed the russian military machine you should put pressure 
i am asking to make sure the russians do not receive a single penny they used to destroy people in ukraine the destruction of our country the destruction of europe 
all american ports should be closed for russian goods 
peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world 
we have to defend the world 
we already became part of the antiwar coalition the big antiwar coalition that unites many countries dozens of countries those who reacted to president putins decision to invade our country 
we need to move on and do more
